# Introduction to EAS 503 Final Project

Welcome to my final project for the EAS 503 course. In this project, I demonstrate my understanding of machine learning models, their implementation, and deployment. Below, you will find all the key elements of this project including experiments, code, and deployment.

## Overview of the Project
The main objective of this project was to apply various machine learning techniques on a given dataset, tune the models, and deploy them using Docker and Streamlit. Additionally, I have used MLFlow for tracking experiments.
