# MLFlow/DagsHub Experiments

In this section, I am tracking all my machine learning experiments using **MLFlow** and **DagsHub**. Both platforms provide version control for machine learning models, experiments, and data, which allows for better reproducibility, collaboration, and management of the entire lifecycle of a machine learning project.

### MLFlow Experiments

I have used **MLFlow** to track the following aspects of my machine learning workflows:

- **Model Training**: Logging hyperparameters, metrics, and the trained models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Recording evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

MLFlow helps in organizing experiments, making it easier to compare different versions of a model and select the best one based on performance metrics.

You can explore these experiments and their details on MLFlow at the following link:

### DagsHub Repository

All experiment data and versioned models are stored on **DagsHub**, a platform designed to manage machine learning projects with integrated version control, allowing seamless collaboration. DagsHub integrates with Git, MLFlow, and DVC (Data Version Control) to streamline project management.

You can explore the project, datasets, and experiment versions on DagsHub here:

### Why MLFlow and DagsHub?

- **MLFlow**: Provides a unified interface for tracking experiments, models, and metrics. It ensures reproducibility by logging all relevant data associated with machine learning workflows.
- **DagsHub**: A collaborative platform for managing datasets, experiments, and models. It integrates with Git and other tools like MLFlow and DVC to make version control in machine learning projects much easier.

These tools have greatly helped me in organizing my work, ensuring reproducibility, and collaborating effectively with other team members.
